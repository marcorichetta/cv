            - Currently interested in enhancing **Developer Experience (DX)** through IaC. Also learning about Go, MLOps, Elixir.
            - My background is in backend but I like to look at the bigger picture and think beyond my specific role. Curiosity drives me but I'm always learning to balance it and prioritize impact.
