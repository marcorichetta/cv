# About Me

I like to share knowledge by [giving](https://www.youtube.com/live/EWofHnNngoc?si=1OpnvzkN-R0NSc2i) [talks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-richetta/overlay/experience/2020463733/multiple-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAABQf7hUBZUJgMc0bcZABQZwPRzETisnwoTM&treasuryMediaId=1635515512870), also as a [mentor](https://frontend.cafe/mentorias) or simply helping others to solve problems. [E.g. the Django forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/u/marcorichetta/summary).

Currently interested in enhancing **Developer Experience (DX)** through IaC. Also learning about Go, MLOps, Elixir.

My background is in backend but I like to look at the bigger picture and think beyond my specific role. Curiosity drives me but I'm always learning to balance it and prioritize impact.
